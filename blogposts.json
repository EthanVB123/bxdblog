        "title": "The Power of Know, Like, and Trust in Business Relationships",
        "text": "Before 2016, I was doing what most business owners do\u2014giving my 60-second elevator pitch about iQuest, talking about who we are, what we do, and why you should buy from us. The goal? To push our products and services. But one question always stuck with me: \nWhy should someone buy from me after just a 10-minute conversation?\n The reality is, most people won\u2019t.\nIt wasn\u2019t until after 2016 that the lightbulb went off. I realized that pushing for a sale right away was all wrong. Business, especially at iQuest, is \nrelationship-based\n, not transactional. People buy from those they \nknow\n, \nlike\n, and \ntrust\n. If you haven\u2019t established that foundation, you're just another business trying to make a quick sale.\nFrom Pushing Products to Building Relationships\nIn today\u2019s world, the focus needs to shift from \"How can I sell you this?\" to \"How can I get to know you?\" It\u2019s \nget to know people first, business second\n. That\u2019s a fundamental shift in mindset, and it\u2019s a powerful one.\nAt iQuest, we\u2019ve built our business on relationships, not transactions. That\u2019s why our approach now is simple: We work with people we know, like, and trust\u2014and expect the same in return. It\u2019s a two-way street. This approach doesn't just lead to sales, it builds long-lasting partnerships.\nThink about it: When was the last time you made a significant purchase from someone you didn\u2019t trust? Probably never. Whether it\u2019s choosing an IT service provider, a lawyer, or even a car dealership\u2014trust is the cornerstone of any relationship.\nA Real-World Example\nHere\u2019s a real-life example of how \nknow, like, and trust\n plays out in business. One of our long-standing clients recently appointed a new CEO. The moment we met, we knew it would be difficult to maintain the relationship. Through my network, I learned that she was connected to one of our competitors and had plans to bring in \"her people\" to replace us.\nShe didn\u2019t know us, didn\u2019t like us, and certainly didn\u2019t trust us. Despite providing exceptional service to that client for years, it didn\u2019t matter in her eyes. In business, these situations are inevitable. You can be providing the best service out there, but without trust, it\u2019s easy for someone new to push you out. And let\u2019s face it, some days you win, some days you lose.\nWhy Know, Like, and Trust Matter More Than Ever\nIn business today, it\u2019s not just about offering the best product or service. People are overwhelmed with choices. The real differentiator is how well they know you, how much they like you, and most importantly, whether they trust you. That\u2019s where the magic happens.\nTake a look at your own business. Are you building relationships first? Or are you too focused on closing the deal right away? \nTrust\n is something you can\u2019t rush, and once you have it, it\u2019s incredibly powerful. At iQuest, we believe that if we build trust first, the business follows naturally.\nPractical Takeaways for Building Trust\nStart with a Conversation, Not a Pitch\n \u2013 Get to know the person before you try to do business. Ask questions, listen, and understand their needs.\nBe Genuine\n \u2013 People can sense when you\u2019re not being authentic. Be yourself, and let them get to know the real you.\nFocus on the Relationship\n \u2013 Business comes and goes, but relationships last. Cultivate those relationships, even when there\u2019s no immediate transaction in sight.\nTrust is Earned, Not Given\n \u2013 Show your clients you\u2019re reliable. Be consistent, follow through on your promises, and don\u2019t just talk the talk\u2014walk the walk.\nAccept That You Can\u2019t Win Them All\n \u2013 As with the new CEO we encountered, sometimes the cards are stacked against you. That\u2019s just business. Focus on what you can control\u2014building relationships that can weather any storm.\nFinal Thoughts\nAt the end of the day, people buy from those they \nknow\n, \nlike\n, and \ntrust\n. It sounds simple, but many businesses overlook this. Building a relationship first makes everything else fall into place. Without trust, you\u2019re just another business in a sea of options. With trust, you\u2019re a partner\u2014and that\u2019s invaluable.\nSo, ask yourself: Are you building relationships, or just closing transactions?\n\u200d",

        "text": "I used to think a business playbook was something only big corporations needed. I was wrong. After years of operating without one, I realized we were wasting time on repetitive decisions and processes. So, we created a playbook that laid out everything\u2014from core values to step-by-step processes for key tasks.\nThis isn\u2019t just a dusty document sitting on a shelf. It\u2019s a living, breathing part of our business. We review and update it regularly, making sure it evolves as we do. The playbook has brought clarity and consistency to everything we do, and it\u2019s been a huge factor in our growth.\nIf you\u2019re looking to scale your business, having a playbook can make all the difference. It\u2019s not about stifling creativity; it\u2019s about creating a foundation that allows your team to operate independently while maintaining quality and efficiency. For any Perth business owner struggling with growth and consistency, a well-crafted playbook is worth its weight in gold.",

        "text": "In today\u2019s fast-paced world, it\u2019s easy to think business development is about closing quick deals and moving on to the next. But let me tell you, if you want long-term success, business development is a marathon, not a sprint.\nSince I started back in 2010, I\u2019ve approached business development in a way that most people overlook. On average, I have four coffee catch-ups and two lunches a week. Here\u2019s the kicker\u2014I don\u2019t sell during these meetings. Why? Because I don\u2019t treat the people I meet as clients; I treat them as peers.\nThe Long Game of Business Development\nI\u2019ve learned that building strong, meaningful relationships is the cornerstone of sustainable business growth. My goal is always to be generous with my time, to leave the people I meet in a better place than I found them. That\u2019s how you build trust, and trust is everything in business.\nOver the years, this approach has paid off. Today, 95% of my new clients come from referrals, and we have an impressive 98% client retention rate over the last decade. Why? Because business development isn\u2019t a one-time effort. It\u2019s a series of activities you need to consistently perform, day in and day out.\nWhy Consistency Matters in Business Development\nA lot of people get business development wrong. They think it\u2019s all about the pitch and closing the deal. But here\u2019s the reality: you can\u2019t just show up when you want something. You need to be present consistently. Building a reliable network takes time, and that means showing up even when there\u2019s no immediate benefit in sight.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve built a network of referrals through long-term business associates. These aren\u2019t just people I call when I need something; they\u2019re advocates for my business. We catch up every few months, and we look out for opportunities for one another. It\u2019s not transactional\u2014it\u2019s relational.\nBusiness Development Requires Time\nThe number one mistake I see business owners make is thinking they don\u2019t have time for business development. The truth is, you can\u2019t afford \nnot\n to make time for it. If you\u2019re constantly chasing short-term wins, you\u2019re missing the bigger picture. Business development is about playing the long game and making the right connections that will serve your business for years to come.\nIf you\u2019re sprinting through your business development activities, burning out, and wondering why you\u2019re not seeing long-term results, it\u2019s time to take a step back. Think about the relationships you\u2019re building. Are you genuinely investing time and effort, or are you just trying to close a quick deal?\nBuilding Your Business Development Network\nHere\u2019s a tip: Start by identifying people you can help, not just people who can help you. Give generously. Leave people in a better place than where you found them. That\u2019s how you build a network that will support you in the long run.\nIf you approach business development as a marathon, you\u2019ll find that the rewards far outweigh the quick wins you get from sprinting.\nFinal Thoughts: Stay the Course\nSo, the next time you think about business development, remember: it\u2019s not about the sprint, it\u2019s about the marathon. Play the long game. Build relationships, not transactions. Be consistent, and watch how your network grows\u2014and with it, your business.\n\u200d",

        "text": "Every economic has cycles\u2014booms and busts\u2014but are you ready for the downturns? You need a \nwar chest\n, and I\u2019ve seen too many businesses crumble because they didn\u2019t have one. At iQuest, we adopt Profit First mentality to build ours, which meant when things slowed down, we could still keep our best employees and cover rising costs.\nThe \nwar chest\n isn\u2019t just about survival; it\u2019s about thriving during tough times and good times. The businesses that fail are usually the ones caught without reserves, forced into bad decisions when revenue dries up. This is directly tied to \nFinancial Management\n, one of the \nBusiness by Design\n 7 Essentials. It\u2019s not just about making money; it\u2019s about being smart with it\u2014tracking it, budgeting for it, and having a buffer when the unexpected happens.\nSo next time you\u2019re in a boom, think about the bust.

        "text": "At iQuest, our success has always been rooted in building strong, long-lasting relationships with our clients. While many businesses focus on transactional, quick wins, we believe that true growth and sustainability come from understanding our clients on a deeper level. This is why we\u2019ve developed a two-tiered client profiling system\u2014one that focuses on our existing clients (internal profiling) and one that helps us better target potential clients and industries (external profiling).\nIn this blog, I\u2019ll walk you through how client profiling has transformed iQuest and why it\u2019s a critical tool for business growth.\nInternal Client Profiling: Understanding What Makes Our Clients Tick\nInternal client profiling is all about diving deep into our clients\u2019 businesses. We don\u2019t just stop at addressing their immediate IT needs. We take the time to understand their business model, their key technology platforms, and even the IT literacy of their teams. This helps us better anticipate their challenges and provide tailored solutions that fit their unique situation.\nOne of the key aspects of our internal client profiling process is regular check-ins. Our team doesn\u2019t just solve a problem and move on; we continuously run client profiles to ensure we\u2019re up to date on any changes within their organization. This helps us stay proactive and maintain strong, lasting relationships with our clients.\nExternal Client Profiling: Targeting the Right Industries and Solving the Right Problems\nWhile internal profiling helps us with existing clients, external profiling is what drives new business. We focus on specific industries\u2014like accounting, for instance\u2014and study their common challenges, technology platforms, and overall needs.\nA few years ago, we made accounting firms one of our primary verticals. To better understand their unique requirements, I joined a national accounting network, which gave me access to over 25 firms across Australia and New Zealand. This wasn\u2019t just about landing new clients\u2014it was about learning how accountants think, what their day-to-day struggles are, and how we could position our services to make their lives easier.\nOn top of that, I started a digital and technology working group where accounting firms could meet monthly to share insights on the latest technology platforms, accounting software, and industry challenges. This initiative wasn\u2019t just about selling our services\u2014it was about becoming a trusted partner in their growth journey.\nThe Results: A Strong ROI, New Clients, and Deep Connections\nAfter five years of focusing on the accounting industry, the return on investment has been huge. Beyond the new clients we\u2019ve gained, we\u2019ve also built strong rapport with decision-makers and created a network of trusted relationships that go far beyond business transactions.\nHere\u2019s what we achieved:\nWe shared valuable knowledge with our management team, allowing us to provide better support to clients in the accounting sector.\nWe built meaningful relationships with accounting firm owners, many of whom have become trusted advisors and friends.\nOur iQuest team now has deep expertise in accounting technology, helping us provide even more value to our current and future clients.\nThe Wolf Pack Model: Building New Relationships and Driving Growth\nAll of this wouldn\u2019t have been possible if I were still involved in the daily operations of iQuest. Instead, I focus on business development and building relationships\u2014what I call our \u201cwolf pack\u201d model. My job is to explore new verticals, build rapport with decision-makers, and then share that knowledge with my team. It\u2019s a collaborative approach that ensures we\u2019re constantly growing while maintaining the highest level of service for our clients.\nWhy Client Profiling Matters for Long-Term Success\nClient profiling is more than just a tool for better customer service\u2014it\u2019s a strategy that helps businesses understand their clients and industries on a deeper level. By continuously refining our internal and external client profiles, we can stay ahead of industry trends, anticipate client needs, and offer solutions that are relevant and timely.\nIf your business is looking to grow sustainably, it\u2019s time to stop focusing on transactions and start focusing on relationships. By getting to know your clients and industry better, you\u2019ll not only improve your service but also open the door to new opportunities and long-term success.\nInterested in learning more about how client profiling can transform your business?

        "title": "The Power of Compounding Growth: How the 10% Rule Transformed Our Business",
        "text": "In business, growth is essential. But it\u2019s not just about rapid expansion\u2014it's about \nsustainable\n growth that protects your profits and keeps operating costs in check. At iQuest, we found ourselves at a point where chasing high growth wasn't as effective anymore. So, we adopted the \n10% Rule\n, and it\u2019s made a huge difference in how we scale and manage the business. Here\u2019s how the power of compounding growth worked for us and how it might help your business too.\nThe Early Days: Chasing High Growth\nWhen you\u2019re just starting out, aggressive growth makes sense. You're trying to establish your business, build your customer base, and gain market share. In the early stages, it\u2019s all about maximizing every opportunity and growing as fast as possible. We went through the same phase at iQuest, chasing big growth targets and doing whatever it took to scale.\nBut here's the thing\u2014once you reach a certain revenue milestone, in my experience, around $2 million, the game changes. At that level, growth becomes harder to sustain due to rising overheads, higher operational costs, and decreasing margins. You\u2019re no longer just focusing on sales, but on managing a growing workforce, infrastructure, and cash flow.\nThat\u2019s when we realized we needed a more sustainable approach to growth. We needed to grow steadily without putting unnecessary strain on our business.\nThe 10% Rule: Small, Consistent Growth Adds Up\nWe started implementing the \n10% Rule\n, which became a game-changer for us. Instead of aiming for huge leaps in revenue each year, we set a goal to increase our revenue by just 10% annually. It sounds small, but here\u2019s where the power of compounding kicks in.\nBy growing steadily at 10% each year, we were able to:\nHit our 5-year revenue target faster than expected\n. The compounding effect of small, consistent growth builds momentum over time.\nAvoid operating cost blowouts\n. We didn\u2019t have to overextend ourselves or take on too many new costs all at once.\nProtect our profits\n. By growing at a manageable rate, we kept profitability intact, avoiding the diminishing returns that can come from scaling too fast.\nWhy the 10% Rule Works\nThe 10% Rule is powerful because it taps into the magic of compounding growth. Just like compound interest in finance, small increases in revenue each year lead to exponential growth over time. It\u2019s not about chasing massive wins, but about setting a steady pace that keeps your business profitable and sustainable.\nHere\u2019s how the 10% Rule helped us stay on track:\nControlled Overhead Growth\n: Growing too quickly can lead to skyrocketing overhead costs, which eat into your profits. By sticking to a manageable growth target, we were able to avoid taking on unnecessary costs, such as hiring too many new employees or expanding our infrastructure too quickly.\nBetter Cash Flow Management\n: With steady growth, we had a better handle on cash flow. We could forecast our financial needs more accurately and ensure that we had enough resources to support our growth without stretching ourselves too thin.\nLong-Term Profit Protection\n: Rapid growth can often lead to shrinking profit margins as you expand. With the 10% Rule, we could maintain healthy profit margins by ensuring that our operating costs didn\u2019t outpace our revenue growth.\nCompounding Growth in Action\nLet me give you an example of how compounding growth works. Say your business has a revenue of $2 million this year. If you grow by 10%, your revenue would be $2.2 million next year. The following year, another 10% increase brings you to $2.42 million. By the end of five years, you\u2019d be looking at a revenue of around $3.22 million\u2014not bad for aiming for what seems like a modest 10% growth annually.\nThis steady increase allows you to gradually scale your operations, hire more people as needed, and invest in infrastructure at the right pace. You\u2019re growing, but you\u2019re also avoiding the high-risk, high-cost issues that come with rapid scaling.\nWhy Steady Growth is Better for Some Businesses\nIt\u2019s important to note that the 10% Rule might not apply to all industries or business models. If you\u2019re in a rapidly expanding industry or have access to venture capital, you may need to grow faster to capture market share. But for businesses like iQuest, where the focus is on long-term sustainability, steady growth offers a way to scale while protecting profits.\nBy focusing on \nhow\n we grow, not just \nhow fast\n we grow, we\u2019ve been able to create a more stable, profitable business. And that\u2019s the real power of compounding growth\u2014it\u2019s not about massive, short-term gains, but about building a strong foundation for long-term success.\nKey Takeaways\nIf your business is reaching the point where rapid growth is becoming harder to sustain, consider the power of the 10% Rule:\nSet realistic growth targets\n that are manageable and don\u2019t put undue strain on your resources.\nLeverage the compounding effect\n to build momentum over time and hit your long-term revenue goals faster.\nProtect your profits\n by ensuring that operating costs don\u2019t outpace revenue growth.\nAt iQuest, we\u2019ve seen firsthand how the 10% Rule can transform the way a business grows. It\u2019s not about making massive leaps\u2014it\u2019s about steady, consistent progress that adds up over time.\nIf you\u2019re ready to rethink your growth strategy, why not give the 10% Rule a try? Small, steady improvements can lead to big results.\n\u200d",

        "text": "A wise businessman once told me, \u201cThe bigger your business, the more time you have.\u201d Sounds counterintuitive, right? But I\u2019ve found it to be true. The key isn\u2019t just growing a business\u2014it\u2019s about building it to operate without you having to be in the weeds every day.\nBusiness success is a collective effort, not just on me.\n You can\u2019t carry the entire load alone. Trust the team you\u2019ve built and empower them to make decisions. When you support your business partners to grow and advance, you create a structure where everyone wins. This lets you step back, see the business from a higher level, and focus on those big-picture initiatives that drive real growth.\nWith iQuest now operating under management, I\u2019ve been able to explore new ventures, like the \nJourney Together Partners' Network\n. This network has grown to include 8 partners across the country and Asia, serving over 400 clients with 65 engineers. The best part? Every quarter, I get to spend a day with each partner, using the 7 essentials framework to help them build their business. It\u2019s the freedom to work on strategic growth instead of just being stuck in the daily grind.\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway?\n You\u2019ve got to build a team that not only supports the business but grows it. This gives you the space to lead, innovate, and most importantly, enjoy a balanced quality of life. It\u2019s not about being in control of everything\u2014it\u2019s about knowing when to let go and letting your business flourish.",

        "title": "Mindset Shift: The Power of Vulnerability in Leadership",
        "text": "In 2016, something big changed for me. It wasn\u2019t about what I was doing, but how I was thinking. I realised the decisions I\u2019d been making weren\u2019t the problem\u2014it was the mindset behind them. The real game-changer? I had to unlearn what I thought I knew and start asking the tough question: \nWhat if I don\u2019t know everything?\nEmbracing the Mindset Shift\nFor years, I\u2019d been operating under the assumption that I had to have all the answers. After all, I was the business owner, the leader. But in 2016, I took a step back and admitted to myself\u2014and my team\u2014that I didn\u2019t have it all figured out. I started saying, \"I don\u2019t know. Please teach me.\" It wasn\u2019t easy, but it was necessary.\nThis shift didn\u2019t just help me grow as a leader; it transformed how I run iQuest. I started looking at problems from multiple angles and sharing my thoughts, ideas, and concerns with my team. Suddenly, it wasn\u2019t just about what I thought\u2014it was about \nhow we\n, as a team, could figure it out together. That\u2019s when I realised the power of the \nwolf pack\n mindset. It\u2019s not one person at the top with all the answers; it\u2019s the strength of the pack that makes the difference.\nThe Power of Vulnerability in Leadership\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve learned in business is that being vulnerable isn\u2019t a weakness\u2014it\u2019s a strength. Too many leaders think they need to have all the answers, but the truth is, the best decisions come when you\u2019re open to learning from others. By admitting that I didn\u2019t know everything, I empowered my team to step up and contribute. We weren\u2019t just following orders; we were working together, thinking together, and growing together.\nThis shift in mindset created an environment where everyone could speak up and share their thoughts. It wasn\u2019t just me dictating the strategy\u2014it was the whole team working in sync, moving forward with a clear vision.\nCase in Point: Fixing iQuest\u2019s Finances\nLet me give you a real-world example of how this mindset shift played out.\nIn 2016, iQuest was in financial trouble. We were facing some tough decisions, and I knew I couldn\u2019t fix it alone. So, I decided to change our accounting firm. The first thing I said to our new accountant was, \u201cHelp me fix my balance sheet.\u201d I didn\u2019t pretend to know more than I did\u2014I asked questions every time I didn\u2019t understand something.\nA week later, our accountant came back with the key metrics we needed to track. Together with my management team, we developed a 12-month strategy to turn things around. That was the moment we started working like a true \nwolf pack\n. We weren\u2019t just reacting to problems anymore; we were proactively solving them together.\nWhy Quality Over Quantity Matters\nThis whole experience taught me one major lesson: \nWe\u2019re judged by the quality of our decisions, not the quantity\n. It\u2019s not about how many decisions you make in a day\u2014it\u2019s about making the \nright\n ones. And you can only do that if you have the right mindset.\nToo often, business owners feel the pressure to know it all, to make quick decisions, and to move fast. But if you\u2019re not slowing down to think critically, to ask questions, and to involve your team, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.\nThe best decisions come from a place of vulnerability, openness, and collaboration. That\u2019s how you build a strong business. That\u2019s how you win.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn business, it\u2019s easy to think that the more decisions you make, the better off you\u2019ll be. But the truth is, it\u2019s the quality of those decisions that really matters. To make better decisions, you have to be willing to unlearn what you think you know, ask for help when you need it, and work with your team to find the right solutions.\nIf you\u2019re still trying to do it all on your own, maybe it\u2019s time for a \nmindset shift\n. The best leaders don\u2019t have all the answers\u2014they ask the right questions.\n\u200d",

        "title": "Play in the Blue Ocean, Not the Red",
        "text": "In today\u2019s business world, it\u2019s easy to get stuck in what\u2019s known as the \nRed Ocean\n\u2014those overcrowded, competitive markets where businesses fight tooth and nail for market share. Companies in the Red Ocean are constantly trying to outdo each other, often resulting in a race to the bottom on pricing, product features, and marketing spend. In contrast, the \nBlue Ocean\n is where smart companies look for uncontested market space\u2014creating new demand and making the competition irrelevant. At iQuest, we\u2019ve embraced this Blue Ocean Strategy to fuel our growth and offer real value to our clients.\nThis concept comes from the book \nBlue Ocean Strategy\n by W. Chan Kim and Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne, which suggests that businesses should stop competing in crowded markets and instead look for opportunities where they can innovate and create new market spaces. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done at iQuest.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how we\u2019ve applied Blue Ocean thinking to our business.\nRed Ocean vs. Blue Ocean\nThe Red Ocean represents industries that already exist. It\u2019s where companies fight each other for the same set of customers, often leading to price wars, reduced margins, and increased competition. Think of it like a shark feeding frenzy\u2014lots of blood in the water, but not enough food for everyone.\nIn contrast, the Blue Ocean represents unknown or untapped market space. It\u2019s about creating demand where there was none before, innovating to solve problems in a new way, and offering unique value that customers can\u2019t get elsewhere. Instead of trying to beat the competition, you make them irrelevant by changing the game altogether.\nSo how do we do that at iQuest? Let me walk you through our own Blue Ocean Strategy.\nOur Blue Ocean Strategy at iQuest\nAt iQuest, we\u2019ve consciously shifted our approach away from competing directly with other IT providers in traditional, saturated markets. Instead, we focus on creating new opportunities and value for our clients through the following strategies:\n1. \nCost Optimization: Doing More With Less\nOne of the biggest challenges in the Red Ocean is the constant pressure to cut costs to compete on price. But instead of playing that game, we\u2019ve focused on increasing our \nefficiency and productivity\n\u2014essentially, doing more with fewer resources. By streamlining our operations and optimizing how we use our time and talent, we\u2019re able to offer better value to our clients without slashing prices.\nThis approach allows us to maintain profitability while still providing high-quality service. We invest in tools, processes, and technologies that help us work smarter, not harder, so we can pass those savings on to our clients without compromising on quality.\n2. \nEliminating Non-Core Activities\nAnother way we\u2019ve embraced Blue Ocean thinking is by eliminating non-core activities that don\u2019t directly contribute to our growth or client satisfaction. Instead of trying to be everything to everyone, we focus on our core strengths\u2014IT solutions that solve real problems for our clients.\nFor example, we\u2019ve cut out services that don\u2019t align with our core offerings, which has not only reduced our overhead but also allowed us to specialize and become experts in what we do best. By focusing on a narrower scope, we\u2019ve been able to offer deeper expertise and create more value for our clients, while improving our profitability.\n3. \nCreating Accessibility with Our JTPN Network\nOne of the ways we\u2019ve expanded our reach is through our Joint Technology Partner Network (JTPN), which allows us to take on larger, multi-site clients. Instead of competing with local IT firms on their turf, we\u2019ve created a network that gives us the capability to handle projects that span multiple locations, offering clients a seamless experience no matter where they are.\nThis unique offering has helped us carve out a space in the market where traditional IT providers struggle to compete, especially with clients that have more complex or geographically distributed needs.\n4. \nSimplifying Our Products and Processes\nWe\u2019ve also taken steps to \nreduce complexity\n in our products, services, and internal procedures. Often, businesses get bogged down by offering too many options or creating overly complicated processes. This not only confuses customers but also increases operational costs.\nBy simplifying what we offer and how we operate, we make it easier for clients to do business with us and for our team to deliver consistently high-quality service. This clarity helps build trust and ensures that we\u2019re providing exactly what the client needs without unnecessary frills.\nThe Power of Win-Win Deals\nA critical aspect of our Blue Ocean Strategy is the emphasis on \nwin-win deals\n. At iQuest, we believe in full transparency with our clients\u2014we\u2019re in business to make a profit, and we expect our clients to get real value in return. We\u2019re open about our costs and processes, and we encourage clients to walk away if they feel we aren\u2019t delivering the value they expect.\nThis mutual respect creates strong, lasting partnerships where both sides are invested in each other\u2019s success. By prioritizing transparency and trust, we\u2019ve been able to build relationships that stand the test of time.\nA Real-World Example: Cirque du Soleil\nOne of the best-known examples of Blue Ocean Strategy is Cirque du Soleil. Instead of competing with traditional circuses, Cirque reinvented the entire concept of live entertainment. They eliminated costly elements like animals and traditional circus acts, instead focusing on artistic performances and storylines that appealed to a more sophisticated audience.\nBy creating a new type of entertainment experience, Cirque du Soleil didn\u2019t have to compete with other circuses\u2014they created their own market and made the competition irrelevant. This is exactly the kind of thinking we apply at iQuest: rather than fighting it out in the Red Ocean, we look for ways to redefine the game and create new value for our clients.\nConclusion: Finding Your Blue Ocean\nAt iQuest, we\u2019ve embraced the Blue Ocean Strategy because it allows us to focus on creating value, rather than constantly battling competitors. By optimizing costs, focusing on core strengths, expanding accessibility, and simplifying our operations, we\u2019ve been able to carve out a unique place in the market where we can thrive without the pressure of Red Ocean competition.\nWhether you\u2019re a small business or a large enterprise, the key takeaway here is that you don\u2019t always have to compete where everyone else is. Sometimes, the best strategy is to change the rules of the game altogether.\n\u200d\n\u200d",

        "title": "Why Unrealistic Growth Targets Can Hurt Your Business",
        "text": "In the fast-paced world of business, it\u2019s easy to think that setting ambitious revenue growth targets will lead to faster success. Many companies aim for 30% to 50% year-on-year (YOY) growth, hoping that big numbers will translate into big wins. But here\u2019s the reality: setting unrealistic growth targets can do more harm than good. In fact, chasing overly high targets can push your team to the brink, create internal conflict, and even damage your bottom line.\nAt iQuest, we learned this lesson early on. Instead of shooting for the stars and risking burnout, we adopted the \n10% Rule\n\u2014a more sustainable and realistic approach to business growth. Here\u2019s why setting achievable growth targets can be the key to long-term success and how the 10% Rule transformed our business.\nThe Problem with Unrealistic Growth Targets\nSetting high revenue targets, like 30% to 50% YOY, might sound impressive, but it often leads to a host of problems:\nTeam Burnout\n: When you push your team too hard with unattainable targets, the pressure builds, and morale drops. Teams start to feel like they\u2019re climbing Mt. Everest without the right gear. The result? Desperation, frustration, and a growing sense that the goal is unachievable.\nInternal Conflicts\n: Unrealistic targets can create tension between departments, especially sales and operations. Sales teams, under immense pressure to hit high numbers, may close deals that operations teams can\u2019t deliver efficiently. This misalignment leads to frustration, lower service quality, and dissatisfied clients.\nUnprofitable Projects\n: In the race to hit lofty growth numbers, companies often take on unprofitable projects just to boost revenue. These short-term gains can lead to long-term losses as the business stretches itself too thin and operates outside its core strengths.\nClient and Staff Turnover\n: High-pressure environments often lead to higher turnover rates, both for clients and employees. If your team is overworked and under pressure, they\u2019re more likely to leave. And when your service quality drops, your clients might follow suit.\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? A more measured approach to growth\u2014one that keeps the team motivated, aligned, and focused on sustainable success.\nThe 10% Rule: A Smarter Way to Grow\nAt iQuest, we implemented the \n10% Rule\n\u2014a simple yet powerful strategy of aiming for 10% growth from the previous year. It\u2019s been a game-changer for us, helping us maintain profitability, retain staff, and grow without unnecessary risk. Here\u2019s why it works:\n1. \nAchievable Targets Keep Teams Motivated\nWhen growth targets are realistic, teams are more likely to stay motivated and driven. A 10% growth target feels within reach, and when teams believe they can achieve something, they\u2019re more committed to making it happen. Instead of being overwhelmed by a seemingly impossible goal, they focus on steady progress.\nIn my experience, this approach has resulted in better team alignment and higher morale. We no longer feel like we\u2019re pushing uphill\u2014we\u2019re climbing steadily and enjoying the journey.\n2. \nBetter Profitability and Cost Control\nWith the 10% Rule, we\u2019ve been able to grow consistently while maintaining profitability. Unlike rapid, aggressive growth that can blow out operating costs, a 10% target allows us to keep a close eye on expenses. We can increase salaries for staff, reinvest in the business, and keep overheads under control without sacrificing our bottom line.\n3. \nAvoiding Unnecessary Risk\nBy aiming for 10% YOY growth, we avoid taking on unprofitable projects or overextending our resources. Instead of scrambling to hit inflated targets, we stay focused on high-quality work that aligns with our core business strengths. This strategy has allowed us to retain clients, build stronger relationships, and avoid costly mistakes.\n4. \nA Focus on Long-Term Success\nThe 10% Rule emphasizes long-term, sustainable growth rather than short-term gains. We\u2019re not interested in quick wins that jeopardize our future. Instead, we\u2019re building a solid foundation that will allow us to grow steadily year after year. This approach has helped us hit our revenue targets faster than expected, while maintaining a healthy, profitable business.\nCase Study: The Cracks in the Business\nBefore implementing the 10% Rule, we faced many of the same challenges that come with chasing unrealistic growth. Our sales team would close deals that operations struggled to fulfill, leading to frustrated clients and a strained workforce. We even saw unprofitable projects take a toll on our margins, pushing us further from our goals.\nBut once we switched to the 10% Rule, things changed. Our team was more aligned, our operations became more efficient, and we saw steady progress without the stress of unattainable targets. By setting more realistic growth expectations, we avoided the cracks that come with overstretching a business.\nWhy You Should Consider the 10% Rule\nNot every business is the same, and the 10% Rule may not apply to all industries. However, if you\u2019re finding that aggressive growth targets are doing more harm than good, it might be time to rethink your approach. A 10% growth target provides a balanced, achievable way to scale your business without pushing your team too hard or overextending your resources.\nBy focusing on manageable, steady growth, you can:\nKeep your team motivated\n and focused on achievable goals.\nProtect your profits\n and avoid costly mistakes.\nMaintain control over operating costs\n and overheads.\nEnsure long-term, sustainable growth\n that doesn\u2019t sacrifice quality.\nConclusion: Sustainable Growth Beats Rapid Expansion\nAt iQuest, the 10% Rule has helped us grow steadily while maintaining profitability and team morale. It\u2019s not about setting the highest possible target\u2014it\u2019s about setting the \nright\n target. By focusing on realistic, sustainable growth, we\u2019ve been able to hit our goals faster than we expected, without the stress and pressure of unrealistic expectations.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with aggressive growth targets that are creating more problems than solutions, consider adopting the 10% Rule. Sometimes, slow and steady really does win the race.\n\u200d",

        "text": "Early on, I thought that providing good service was enough to keep clients loyal. But I soon realised that loyalty comes from good partnership with clients. They want to work with a company they can trust, understood and valued beyond the service. I remember one client who had a major management issue late on a Friday afternoon. \u00a0I made sure we were there to help them sort it out in the technology, business and personal level. That client has stayed with us for over ten years now.\nIt\u2019s not about the technology or the service offering; it\u2019s about the deeper relationship you build. We focus on understanding our clients deeply\u2014what drives them, what challenges they face, and how we can add value beyond just solving their immediate IT problems. It\u2019s about creating a partnership, not just a transaction.\nIf you\u2019re looking to strengthen your client relationships, start by getting to know them on a business and personal level. In Perth, where business is often about who you know and trust, building these connections can be a game-changer.\u00a0 When you show that you genuinely care about their success, they\u2019ll stick with you through thick and thin.\n\u200d",

It led to friction and stagnation because they weren\u2019t invested in the same goals I was. It took me a while, but I realized that finding the right people\u2014those who not only bring skills to the table but also buy into the business vision\u2014is crucial.\nI remember having to let go of a few team members who were technically competent but didn\u2019t fit where the business was heading. It wasn\u2019t easy, but once we had a team that shared the vision, everything changed. We became more efficient, more innovative, and more successful.\nNow, I focus on building a team that can carry the vision forward. It\u2019s not just about what they can do; it\u2019s about how they think and whether they\u2019re willing to push the business in the right direction. We\u2019ve created a culture where everyone knows the vision and understands their role in achieving it. This kind of alignment doesn\u2019t happen by accident; it takes deliberate effort to communicate, train, and empower your people.\nIf you\u2019re in Perth and struggling with your team, it might be time to step back and look at the bigger picture. Are your people just doing their jobs, or are they actively contributing to the vision?

You feel the client squeezing your margins, holding all the cards while you\u2019re practically begging for their work. I\u2019ve been there too many times, and it\u2019s a miserable place to be.\nWe used to buy into the old BS that the client always has the upper hand. But as part of our rebuild, we decided that every deal must be a \nWIN-WIN\n. It\u2019s about creating a level playing field, a genuine human-to-human interaction. We exist to make a profit, and we\u2019re not shy about it.\nHere\u2019s a story for you:\n In the early years, we had a legal client. They were always calling me to their office for minor IT issues, mostly user errors. But each time, they\u2019d push for fee reductions, accuse us of breaching the contract, even threaten to sue. It was stressful, my team hated it, but we put up with it because their fees were good.\nThat client was the first I cut during our rebuild. They were shocked, upset, and it was a hit to their ego. But I didn\u2019t need the stress. The new iQuest has a backbone. If a client can\u2019t show basic respect for our team or acknowledge that we\u2019re here to make a profit too, it\u2019s not worth working with them.\nSuccessful partnerships are built on mutual respect and understanding. Without those, it\u2019s just not worth the hassle. You\u2019ve got to know when to walk away, even if it stings a bit.

        "text": "One of the best leadership lessons I\u2019ve picked up didn\u2019t come from a typical business book\u2014it came from football. Sir Alex Ferguson, the iconic manager of Manchester United, understood that success wasn\u2019t about signing the biggest names. It was about building a team that shared his vision and bought into the culture he created.\nFerguson\u2019s goal was clear: make Manchester United the most successful club in England, surpassing Liverpool. But instead of relying on high-priced players, he developed talent from within. His famous \u201cClass of 92,\u201d which included players like Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, wasn\u2019t just a talented squad\u2014they embodied the discipline and drive needed to achieve the vision.\nWhat really stands out is his no-nonsense leadership style. Ferguson made it clear that \nnobody is bigger than the club.\n This led to tough decisions, including selling star players like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo when they no longer aligned with the team\u2019s values. That\u2019s what true leadership looks like\u2014protecting the culture at all costs.\nAt iQuest, we\u2019ve had our own \u201cClass of 2016.\u201d These aren\u2019t just employees\u2014they\u2019re key players in driving the business vision forward. Two of them have even become business partners. Just like Ferguson\u2019s team, they\u2019re helping lead the way, pushing our business towards success.\nThe real takeaway? Building a strong, successful business starts with the right people. When your team shares your vision and values, they\u2019re not just filling roles\u2014they\u2019re actively driving your business forward.\nAsk yourself: Are you building a team that\u2019s aligned with your vision, or are you just hiring to fill positions?\n\u200d",

Have Money, No Time - Risky Business\nIf I\u2019ve got the money but no time, I can hire people to handle the work. Sounds simple, right? But it\u2019s riskier than you think. There\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll make a few wrong hires before the right team is in place. The big question: \nWill I still have the money by then?\n It\u2019s a game of patience and balance. If I run out of time and funds before the team clicks, I\u2019m in trouble.\n2. Have Time, No Money - My Favorite Challenge\nThis is my sweet spot\u2014the \u201csurvival mode\u201d and \u201cthink outside the box\u201d mindset. Time is a critical asset in any business venture. With time, I can:\nChallenge my thought process\n while developing a solid business plan.\nFind the right people\n and get their buy-in.\nExplore creative ways to source money.\nThe process is harder, but that\u2019s what makes it satisfying. It\u2019s about building from the ground up and finding strength in constraints.\n3. No Time, Little Money - Forget It\nIt amazes me when people jump into new ventures without time or money.

We can either pick it up or have it delivered via courier. Over-servicing looks like this: my colleague drives to the supplier\u2019s warehouse, picks up the laptop, drives back to the office, and starts working on it immediately. This action results in a loss of time, money, and productivity for our business.\nDoes it matter if the client gets the laptop today, tomorrow, or in three days? Not really. The urgency is unnecessary and counterproductive. At best, you\u2019ll get a \u201cthank you, you\u2019re great.\u201d But here\u2019s the kicker\u2014when a client says they need something in three days, they usually have a buffer of four or five days. If you rush it out, you\u2019re setting a precedent. Next time, they\u2019ll expect an even shorter timeframe. That\u2019s how you train clients to become \ndemanding clients\n.\nSo, how do you create value instead?\n In the same scenario, say this: \u201cMr. Client, it seems like you\u2019re traveling with the laptop quite a bit. Why don\u2019t you get one with LTE built-in rather than hot-spotting with your phone?\u201d Or, \u201cI found a deal that costs an additional $150\u2014would you be interested?\u201d This is how you create value. You\u2019re solving a problem they might not even realise they have and enhancing their experience, rather than just doing more work for the sake of it.\nRemember, delivering value is about smart service, not over-service. It\u2019s about making a real difference, not just ticking boxes.\n\u200d",

        "title": "Why Financial Literacy is a Non-Negotiable Skill for Business Owners",
        "text": "As a business mentor, the first thing I do with new clients is dive straight into their financials. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re turning over millions or just scraping by\u2014those numbers tell the real story. Let me share one particular case that\u2019s stuck with me.\nThis business was pulling in over $10 million a year. Gross profit was sitting at a healthy 55%, and their net profit hovered around 12%. On the surface, that sounds like a well-run, profitable company, right? But when I walked through the door, the reality hit me\u2014this business was struggling to keep its head above water. Cash flow was tight, operations were a mess, and the owners couldn\u2019t figure out why they were fighting fires every day.\nHere\u2019s the thing: the profit and loss statement or balance sheet might look impressive, but if you\u2019re not financially literate as a business owner, you\u2019re blind to what\u2019s really happening in your company.\nUnderstanding the Numbers\nAs I worked with the GM, finance team, and accountants, we had to peel back layer after layer. The problem wasn\u2019t just in operations (that\u2019s another story), it was how things were recorded, how costs were booked, and how profits were calculated. It became clear that, even with all the professionals involved, no one really had a firm grasp on the company\u2019s financial health.\nOnce we nailed down a clear understanding of the finances and identified the root causes of the issues, implementing fixes became a lot easier. But this didn\u2019t happen because I\u2019m an accountant\u2014I\u2019m not. It happened because I\u2019ve made it a point to understand the basics of financials as a business owner.\nKnow Enough to Be Dangerous\nLook, I\u2019m not saying you need to be crunching numbers like a CFO, but you need to know enough to be dangerous. You need to know how to ask your accountant the right questions, how to spot red flags in your P&L, and most importantly, how to use those numbers to make smarter decisions. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re at the mercy of your finance team, and trust me, that\u2019s a risk you don\u2019t want to take.\nIn my early days, I thought I could just \u201cwing it\u201d when it came to financials. It wasn\u2019t until a major crisis with my own company that I realised flying blind was a recipe for disaster. From then on, I made financial literacy a non-negotiable part of running a business. I met with my accountant regularly, broke down the numbers into manageable chunks, and tracked everything that mattered\u2014from profit margins to cash flow forecasts.\nFinancial Literacy Isn\u2019t Optional\nFinancial literacy is often the overlooked skill that separates successful business owners from those just trying to survive. If you don\u2019t understand your numbers, you\u2019re just guessing your way through decisions, and guessing is never a good business strategy.\nI\u2019ve seen too many businesses that look good on paper but are a financial mess behind the scenes. They\u2019ve got great revenue, decent margins, but no cash flow. They\u2019re stuck in a cycle of debt and constant financial strain. And it all comes down to one thing: a lack of understanding when it comes to managing their numbers.\nSo here\u2019s the challenge for you: if you want to lead a business, if you want to create something that lasts, you \nmust\n understand the financial side. It\u2019s not enough to leave it to your accountant or financial advisor. You need to take ownership of your business\u2019s financial health.\nThe Bottom Line\nAt the end of the day, financial literacy is not just about keeping your business afloat\u2014it\u2019s about giving you the control to make the right decisions. When you know your numbers, you can steer the ship through good times and bad. You\u2019ll be able to spot opportunities and navigate challenges before they become crises.\nIt\u2019s time to stop asking where your money went and start telling your dollars where to go. Financial literacy isn\u2019t a nice-to-have; it\u2019s a must-have for any business owner serious about success.\nI discuss this and several other critical principles in the 7 Essentials mastermind event. Choose a date that suits you and come learn how to take the reigns back. ",

        "text": "Most business owners get stuck in the day-to-day grind, thinking the business itself is what drives success. But here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s not. Your \npersonal vision\n drives your \nbusiness vision\n. If you haven\u2019t figured out your personal \u2018why,\u2019 you\u2019re probably spinning your wheels without even knowing it.\nI didn\u2019t figure this out until I was years into running \niQuest Consulting Pty Ltd\n .

        "title": "Leverage, Leverage, Leverage: Why Relationships Matter More Than Knowledge in Business",
        "text": "We\u2019ve all heard the classic saying in property: \nlocation, location, location\n. It\u2019s the golden rule, the thing that makes or breaks a deal. But in business? I\u2019d argue the mantra should be \nleverage, leverage, leverage\n.\nA Lesson From My Teenage Years\nWhen I was a teenager, I spent my school holidays in a small town in Malaysia. During those holidays, I spent a lot of time with my uncle, who was the chair of the local chamber of commerce. He was incredibly successful and well-known in town\u2014not just for his business acumen, but for his ability to connect people.\nHe\u2019d bring me along to breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with his business associates. To me, it was a crash course in the power of \nrelationships\n. My uncle wasn\u2019t just making deals; he was leveraging his reputation, his status, and his network. People trusted him, and they knew that by associating with him, they could get things done faster and more effectively. He had influence, and that influence was his greatest tool.\nThat\u2019s when I learned one of the most important business lessons of my life: \nWho you know often outweighs what you know\n.\nLeverage: The Underrated Key to Success\nSo what do I mean by leverage? It\u2019s not just about using your connections to get ahead\u2014it\u2019s about \nmutual benefit\n. It\u2019s about positioning yourself in a way where others see value in knowing you, where your network becomes a source of strength, and where you can influence outcomes simply by being part of the conversation.\nIn my uncle\u2019s case, he was a master of leverage. People sought him out because they trusted him to connect them with the right people. And in return, his network helped him secure opportunities that may have otherwise been out of reach.\nThe Connector Advantage\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced, highly competitive business world, being a connector gives you a massive advantage. When you can leverage relationships, you\u2019re not just relying on what \nyou\n know\u2014you\u2019re tapping into what \neveryone\n around you knows.\nThis was one of the biggest mindset shifts for me as I grew into my own business career. Early on, I thought business success was all about knowledge\u2014about knowing the right strategies, tactics, and techniques. But over time, I realized that success often hinges on \nwho\n you know, not just \nwhat\n you know. The more I could build meaningful relationships, the more opportunities opened up for me.\nThe Power of Trust and Leverage\nLet me be clear: leveraging relationships isn\u2019t about manipulation. It\u2019s about building \ntrust\n. When people trust you, they are more likely to work with you, recommend you, and introduce you to others. Trust is the foundation that allows you to leverage relationships effectively. Without it, leverage is nothing more than an empty tactic.\nWhen you\u2019re known as someone who can connect the dots, solve problems, or add value, you become the person others turn to. That\u2019s the kind of leverage that opens doors. Whether you\u2019re working on closing a big deal, securing a strategic partnership, or even hiring the right talent, \ntrust\n and \nrelationships\n are your most powerful tools.\nHow to Build Leverage in Your Business\nIf you want to build leverage in your business, it starts with relationships. Here are a few ways to do it:\nExpand Your Network\n \u2013 Make an effort to meet new people in your industry. Attend events, join professional groups, and connect with others online. Every new connection is an opportunity to build your leverage.\nOffer Value First\n \u2013 Don\u2019t approach relationships with a \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d mindset. Focus on providing value to others. This could be through advice, introductions, or helping solve a problem. People remember those who help without expecting anything in return.\nBe a Connector\n \u2013 Just like my uncle, be the person who brings others together. Whether it\u2019s connecting a colleague with a potential client or introducing two people who could collaborate, being the connector builds your reputation and your leverage.\nInvest in Trust\n \u2013 Trust isn\u2019t built overnight. It takes time, consistency, and integrity. Always follow through on your promises, keep your word, and show up for others. Trust is your currency when it comes to leverage.\nLeverage Your Reputation\n \u2013 As your network grows, so will your reputation. People will begin to associate you with certain values\u2014whether that\u2019s reliability, innovation, or expertise. Use that reputation to your advantage when forming partnerships or securing deals.\nLeverage as a Long-Term Strategy\nLeverage isn\u2019t a quick fix; it\u2019s a long-term strategy. It\u2019s not about pushing for what you want immediately, but about positioning yourself so that opportunities naturally come your way. It\u2019s about playing the long game, building meaningful relationships, and ensuring that you\u2019re a person people \nwant\n to know, trust, and work with.\nAt the end of the day, business isn\u2019t just about knowledge. It\u2019s about \npeople\n. It\u2019s about how you can use your relationships to create win-win situations for everyone involved. That\u2019s where the real power lies.\nFinal Thoughts\nSo, the next time you think about your business strategy, remember this: in property, it\u2019s all about \nlocation\n. In business, it\u2019s all about \nleverage\n. And leverage, my friend, is all about \nwho you know\n.\nThe most successful businesses aren\u2019t built in isolation\u2014they\u2019re built on the back of relationships, connections, and trust.\n#Leverage #BusinessRelationships #Networking #Trust #BusinessGrowth #PerthBusiness\n\u200d",

        "title": "Revenue is Vanity, Profit is Sanity, Cash is Reality: The Realities of Financial Management",
        "text": "When it comes to business success, many owners love to talk about their revenue figures. It\u2019s an impressive number to throw around at functions or networking events, but revenue alone doesn\u2019t tell the full story. In fact, chasing high turnover without focusing on profitability and cash flow can lead to significant financial strain.\nA few months ago, I found myself sitting next to a business owner at an event. After exchanging the usual pleasantries, he proudly shared that his business had a $10 million turnover and 60 employees. While those numbers might sound impressive at first, I immediately knew that turnover wasn\u2019t the full picture.\nIn today\u2019s blog, we\u2019re going to dive into why revenue is often more about vanity than real success, and why focusing on profit and cash flow is critical for the long-term sustainability of any business.\nThe Reality Behind Turnover\nWhen this business owner shared his numbers, I did a quick mental calculation based on his industry, and it painted a very different picture than he might have realized. Here\u2019s what that looked like:\n60 employees\n at an average cost of $100,000 each (including superannuation, taxes, and benefits) = \n$6 million in employee costs\n.\nOperating expenses\n, including taxes, would likely be at least \n$1 million\n.\nThat leaves around \n$3 million in product sales\n, but given the typical margin in his industry, he\u2019d likely make only a 10% margin, which equals \n$300,000\n in gross profit.\nAfter paying all expenses, his business might be earning less than 3% net profit on $10 million in revenue\u2014if everything runs perfectly. And let\u2019s be honest, in business, things rarely run perfectly.\nThe takeaway here is that \nhigh revenue\n does not necessarily mean high profitability. A business can turn over millions of dollars and still barely break even\u2014or worse, lose money.\nRevenue vs. Profit vs. Cash Flow\nIt\u2019s easy to get fixated on revenue because it\u2019s a big, impressive number. But here\u2019s the truth:\nRevenue is vanity\n: It looks good on paper, but it doesn\u2019t tell you much about how well the business is really doing.\nProfit is sanity\n: This is the number that truly reflects how well your business is performing. After all, what\u2019s the point of running a business if you\u2019re not turning a profit?\nCash is reality\n: Profit means nothing if you don\u2019t have cash flow to support your operations. Cash is the lifeblood of any business, and without it, even profitable businesses can collapse.\nThis is why it\u2019s critical to focus on more than just revenue. To achieve long-term business success, you need to manage profitability and cash flow carefully. Here\u2019s how you can do it.\n1. \nFocus on Profitability, Not Just Revenue\nThe biggest mistake many business owners make is focusing too much on increasing revenue without ensuring that their profit margins are sustainable. If your costs are too high, your revenue will be eaten up by expenses, leaving little to no profit at the end of the day.\nTo improve profitability, you need to:\nManage costs\n carefully. Look at both fixed and variable costs and find areas where you can reduce unnecessary expenses.\nOptimize operations\n to improve efficiency, ensuring you\u2019re getting the most out of your resources without overspending.\nFocus on higher-margin products or services\n. Selling more doesn\u2019t help if the margin is too small. Prioritize offerings that generate better returns.\n2. \nKeep a Close Eye on Cash Flow\nEven if your business is profitable on paper, poor cash flow management can lead to serious issues. Cash flow is the amount of money coming in and going out of your business at any given time, and if you don\u2019t have enough cash on hand to cover your expenses, your business will quickly run into trouble.\nHere are some strategies to manage cash flow effectively:\nKeep tight control on receivables\n: Ensure that clients pay their invoices on time. Consider shortening payment terms or offering incentives for early payments.\nManage payables efficiently\n: Stretch out your payables (without harming supplier relationships) to improve your cash position.\nBuild a cash reserve\n: Having a \u201cwar chest\u201d of cash set aside can help your business weather tough times or unexpected expenses.\n3. \nProfit Margins Matter More Than Turnover\nIt\u2019s far better to run a smaller business with healthy profit margins than a larger one with slim or negative margins. Bigger isn\u2019t always better. Focusing on turnover without a clear strategy for profitability can create an illusion of success, but it won\u2019t keep your business afloat long-term.\nIn my experience, businesses that prioritize steady, manageable growth with healthy margins are far more sustainable than those chasing aggressive revenue goals at the expense of profitability.\nThe Illusion of Growth Without Profit\nToo many businesses fall into the trap of believing that more sales automatically lead to more profit. The truth is, as your revenue grows, so do your expenses. This includes hiring more staff, investing in infrastructure, and managing higher operating costs. Without careful management, your expenses can easily outpace your revenue growth, leaving your business in a worse financial position.\nTake the example of the business owner I met\u2014his $10 million turnover and large staff count might look impressive on the surface, but with razor-thin margins, the reality is he\u2019s working much harder for very little reward.\nConclusion: Don\u2019t Let Revenue Fool You\nAs business owners, it\u2019s important not to get caught up in vanity metrics like revenue. Yes, turnover matters, but it\u2019s not the full story. Profitability and cash flow are what truly determine the health of your business. By focusing on profit and cash, you\u2019ll ensure that your business is not just surviving but thriving.\nAt the end of the day, remember this:\nRevenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is reality.\nIf you want to build a financially sound business, keep your eye on what really matters\u2014profit and cash flow.\n\u200d",
